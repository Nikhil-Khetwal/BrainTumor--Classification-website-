                ### What is a Tumor?

                - A tumor is an abnormal mass of tissue resulting from uncontrolled cell growth.
                - These growths can occur in various body parts, including the brain. 
                - Tumors are categorized as benign or malignant.
                - Benign tumors are non-cancerous and grow slowly.
                - while malignant tumors are cancerous and aggressive, potentially spreading to other areas of the body. 
                - Symptoms vary based on location and size, often including headaches and seizures.
